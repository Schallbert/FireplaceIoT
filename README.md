# FireplaceIoT
! Work in Progress !

My first IoT project: Idea is to use an ESP32 to control a digital fireplace. LEDs simulate a cosy campfire controlled via MQTT over WiFi. 

## Code modules
* WiFi control
* MQTT client
* Power manager as application is battery controlled
* LED control
* Sound control (optional)
* Steam control (optional)
